## Form Validation

> jQuery Form Validation

* Smart input validation - doesn't validate until a meaningful
event occurs
* Neat and tidy - Tooltips and animated requirement lists are
hidden until an input is selected
* Prevents form submission until all fields are valid
* Continuous feedback from password requirements to 
let you know how good your password is
